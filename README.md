Problem Statement <br>  
  
Air pollution poses serious health risks, especially when Air Quality Index (AQI) levels cross unhealthy thresholds.<br>  
Timely alerts allow governments and individuals to take preventive measures such as limiting outdoor activities.<br>  

This project builds a machine learning classification system that predicts whether AQI will reach unhealthy levels based on historical pollutant concentrations and weather conditions. <br>  
The model is exposed via a REST API to enable real-time alert generation.<br>
